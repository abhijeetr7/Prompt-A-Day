ðŸ’¡ Concept
Prompt-A-Day is a web application designed to encourage daily journaling, creativity, and mindful reflection. It presents users with a unique reflective writing prompt each day, providing a dedicated space to capture their thoughts and build a personal archive of their insights.

ðŸ›  Features
Daily Reflective Prompt: A new thought-provoking prompt is presented every day, rotating from a preset list and user-added custom prompts.

Inspirational Quote: Each daily prompt is accompanied by a random inspirational quote to spark further reflection.

Answer Box: A dedicated text area for users to write their daily journal entries.

Automatic Saving: Entries are automatically saved to the user's private journal archive in real-time as they type.

Journal Archive: A scrollable list of all past entries, grouped by month and year for easy navigation.

Search Functionality: Users can search through their journal entries (prompts and answers) to quickly find specific reflections.

Favorite Entries: Option to "favorite" important or meaningful entries for quick access.

Filter by Favorites: Toggle to display only favorited entries in the archive.

Prompt Management: Users can add and delete their own custom prompts, which will be included in the daily rotation.

Export Journal: Ability to export the entire journal as a PDF document.

ðŸ”§ Technologies
Frontend:

HTML5: Structure of the web application.

Tailwind CSS: For rapid and responsive styling, ensuring a clean and modern user interface across various devices.

jsPDF Library: Used for client-side generation and export of journal entries into PDF format.

Backend/Data Storage:

Firebase Firestore: A NoSQL cloud database used for securely saving and synchronizing user journal entries and custom prompts in real-time. Each user's data is stored privately.
